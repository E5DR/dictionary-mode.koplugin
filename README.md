# KOReader Dictionary Mode Plugin

This plugin will add a new option _Dictionary Mode_ unter _Main Menu_ > _Settings_ > _Taps and gestures_.\
When enabled, dictionary lookups will be triggered simply by tapping a word.

Please mind that _dictionary mode_ will conflict with other tap actions like page turns.\
For page turns, either use your device's hardware buttons (if any) or swiping.

## Install

Create a new folder _dictionarymode.koplugin_ inside your KOReader _plugins_ folder and copy all the files from this repository into it.
Make sure the plugin is enabled under _Main Menu_ > _Options_ > _More Tools_ > _Plugin Management_.
